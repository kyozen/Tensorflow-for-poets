# Tensorflow Image Classifer-for-poets

My first tensorflow training to train an image classifier. Thanks to [Google codelab developers](https://github.com/googlecodelabs)

To run [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) on a single machine, and will train a simple classifier to classify images of flowers.

The exact codelab can be found [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0)

Using transfer learning, we have to start using a model that has been already trained. 
But I will be retraining it on a similiar task.
Reason is because it takes lesser time, and deep learning takes many days to train a model. 

Personally I am using docker quickstart terminal: info [here](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/)
on how to install docker for windows if you are using windows like me.

## Objectives:
+ to use python and tensorflow to train an image classifer 
+ to classify images with my trained classifer 



## Steps to take:
1. Install tensorflow in terminal (you can use your normal command prompt or docker terminal) -> pip install --upgrade tensorflow, 
(require python 3.5, or python 3.6.4 but im using python 3.5.2)
2. Clone the git respository by typing 
git clone https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2
